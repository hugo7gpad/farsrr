    visualize data on accidents recorded by time, date, geographical information
    such as: city, State, longitude, latitude... and more. The fars_read() 
    function read such type of data into R as tibble. The function make_filename()
    creates annual accidents reports file name in a specified format.
    fars_read_years() extract all rows in the file of each year in a list or
    numerical vector years and returns a list of 2 columns tibbles for each year.
    The fars_summarize_years() gives summary of numbers of accidents in each month
    of each year in a numeric vector of years. Finally, fars_map_state() draw a 
    map of a region in a state with locations where accidents occurred in a given
    year. A data from US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Fatality
    Analysis Reporting System is included to illustrate how to use these functions.
